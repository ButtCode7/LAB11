                        Yesterday, I went to the store and got some
                        much needed spatulas! (what better way to say
                        I love myself than to buy myself a spatula?)

                        My favorite cartoon character is cookie, and
                        my favorite dessert is cupcakes. So Cookie
                        Cupcakes are best of both the worlds. Did you
                        know? Cookie character once said,
                        "Sometimes me think what is love, and then me
                        think love is what cookie is for. Me give up the
                        last cookie for you." I wonder if the same
                        applies for the cupcakes? (if so, I don't think I can ever love ANYONE!)
